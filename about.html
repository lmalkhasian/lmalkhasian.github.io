				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>My name is Lena (it's pronounced like Jenna with an L). I'm a 
				Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Human-computer interaction. 
				I used to be a software engineer in a very short past life. I got my Bachelor's degree 
				in Computer Science from the University of Michigan. GO BLUE! 
				I'm excited to see where this year will take me :) . Please feel free to 
				<a href="contact.html">reach out</a> with any comments, feedback about the site or even 
				just to say hi.</p>
				<!--
				<p>Here's a word cloud I've created from scratch after collecting 
				data from my friends. I asked them to describe me in their own words, 
				and I didn't edit any of their responses.</p>
