                    <h3>About the Somali Bantu Association's Website Redesign</h3>
                    <p>I partnered with the passionate people of the Somali
                    Bantu Association of America to redesign their website
                    into a more engaging experience for visitors. The Somali
                    Bantu Association is a non-profit organization that
                    works with Somali Bantu and other African refugees to
                    help them with their transition into western culture.
                    After conducting research into what they do, I
                    redesigned their website and provided mid-fidelity wireframes to their team.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Design Details</h3>
                    <p>After outlining the goals for the redesign with stakeholders in the organization, I redesigned the new website to address each of the specified goals.</p>
                    <ol class="default">
                        <li>Make the website more engaging by using <strong>more images and stories</strong> of the Somali Bantu, and the people who work at the SBAOA. <br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications: I added a hero image to every main page of the website. I also integrated pictures and videos into the content and used visuals where appropriate to help tell stories. For example, on the donate page, we use a pie chart to communicate how donation money is used. I also designed a more dynamic “About Us” page to highlight the hard-working people in the organization who make it all run smoothly.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Make donating easy</strong> and highly accessible.<br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications: I gave the donate link in the navigation bar more focus. Encouraged more of the workflow to be within the SBAOA website before transferring the user to PayPal.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Encourage users to sign up for the newsletter and remain <strong>engaged with the organization after they leave the site.</strong><br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications:  I created a new page called “Get Involved” to give people who couldn’t donate money an opportunity to contribute to the organization. I kept the form to sign up for the newsletter in the footer, but also added it to a lot of other places in the site as appropriate.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Help users understand the SBAOA</strong>'s role in the community--Have users be able to answer what services does this organization provide?<br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications: I interviewed stakeholders at the SBAOA to learn more about their services. Then, I reorganized how the website talks about these services and provided copy that explains each in more detail.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Build empathy</strong> by explaining why Somali Bantu refugees need aid when coming to America.<br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications: I created an “About the Somali Bantu” page that provides a brief history about the Bantu’s history, visualizes where they are from, and provides success stories of refugees the SBAOA has helped.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Make the site skimmable.</strong><br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications: I edited all of the content on the website to be more concise. I used headers and subheaders as an opportunity to describe the content below, rather than label sections.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Design a <strong>simple, clear and concise navigation system</strong> that enables users to find content easily.<br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications:  I used a bottom up approach to organize the new and existing content on the website by affinity. The affinities became the new nav bar.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Revamp the website's <strong>aesthetic.</strong><br/>
                            <ul class="default" style="font-style:italic;"><li>Design implications: More visuals. Less text. A clear, flexible grid.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>


                <h3>Process</h3>

                <section>
                    <h3>Define Goals for the Redesign</h3>
                    <p>The first thing I did was learn about the
                    organization and outline goals for the redesign with
                    the Somali Bantu Association. (See above.)</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Literature Review and Guerilla Interviews</h3>
                    <p>I did a bit of research to learn about the
                    non-profit space, and what people want to do on non
                    profit websites. I did this by 1. Reading up online and
                    2. Quick guerilla interviews with people who I knew.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>2 Key Use Cases</h3>
                    <p>I created 2 use cases based on what I found during my research to help me organize the information on the site based on users' needs. For each use case, I defined the tasks a user would need to complete to be successful.</p>

                    <strong>Someone who knows the SBAOA visits the website to donate.</strong>
                    <ol class="default">
                      <li>Go to the SBAOA website.</li>
                      <li>Read up on current and recent events that the SBAOA has organized to understand what her donation has helped accomplish.</li>
                      <li>Donate money to the SBAOA.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <strong>Someone who has heard of the SBAOA visits the website to find out more.</strong>
                    <ol class="default">
                      <li>Google organization and visit the SBAOA website.</li>
                      <li>Learn about the organization’s mission, programs and people involved.</li>
                      <li>Sign up for the newsletter to stay informed about events to potentially get involved in.</li>
                    </ol>

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Information Design</h3>
                    <p>The first thing I wanted to design was the website’s
                    content. I went through every word of the website and
                    edited it to be more concise, and better organized. I
                    used a bottom up approach to create a navigation plan
                    for existing and new content.
                    </p>

                    </div></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Low-fidelity Concept Sketches</h3>
                    <p>Then I moved onto creating sketches and concepts for the website.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="6u">
                            <div class="image feature nobackground captioned">
                                <img src="img/work/sbaoa/sbaoa-sketches1.jpg" alt="website sketch 1" />
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="6u">

                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Mockups, Testing, and UI Specs</h3>
                    <p>I digitized the sketches and tested those wireframes with 2 potential users, made a few changes to the naming in the navigation, and then created mid-fidelity wireframes for the SBAOA.<br/></br>
