                <h2>Eaton Capstone Project</h2>

                <section>
                
                    <p>
                        Eaton is a power management company, with many different sectors
                        and businesses. Our capstone project focuses on their Switchgear
                        products. Switchgears (in a nutshell) do what fuse boxes do,
                        except on a very large scale. For example, a typical Low Voltage
                        Switchgear can manage the power for an entire university. The
                        Eaton capstone project is an 8-month project that I will be
                        involved in from January to August 2014. My three teammates and
                        I, Team Lumin, are trying to envision how service engineers will
                        interact with power management systems in the next 5, 10, or 15
                        years. Our goal is to create the future of switchgear-human
                        interaction to enhance the safety, reliability and efficiency of
                        power management systems.                    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>Role Description</h3>
                        My role on the team is to design and finalize the research plan.
                        As a team we will also be collecting data from users, and
                        synthesizing that data to inform our brainstorm for our visioning
                        phase. Additionally, we will have to do rapid prototyping and
                        usability testing in the summer to test our solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        We began the project by trying to understand and define the
                        scope of this project with our clients at Eaton, and doing
                        extensive background research. The background research
                        includes a comprehensive competitive analysis, and going
                        onsite to see and interact with Eaton Switchgears first hand.

                        Next, we put together our research plan, which we are
                        currently in the process of implementing. We are employing a
                        variety of methods including contextual inquiry, interviews,
                        card sorting, business origami, and more, to get rich data
                        and a firm understanding of our users’ wants and needs.

                        In the next steps of the project, we will be synthesizing the
                        data we collected, and creating models. Afterwards, we’ll
                        brainstorm and vision three key ideas. In the summer
                        semester, starting in May, we will be prototyping iteratively
                        and conducting usability tests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We would like to send a huge thank you to our Eaton sponsors,
                        our faculty mentors-Jason Hong and Skip Shelly, Carnegie
                        Mellon University and the Human Computer Interaction
                        Institute for all of their help in this project.
